This project is part of my final assessment for the Database Systems course, showcasing a comprehensive implementation of both SQL and NoSQL database concepts alongside Python programming. The application integrates the strengths of structured and unstructured data storage, reflecting real-world scenarios where hybrid database solutions are often required. By leveraging SQL for relational data and NoSQL for flexible, schema-less storage, the project demonstrates a balanced approach to managing diverse datasets effectively.

A key feature of the application is its Recommender System, which analyzes user preferences and data patterns to provide personalized recommendations. The system is built using Python's robust libraries for data processing and machine learning, ensuring high performance and accuracy. The front-end interface, designed with Tkinter, offers an intuitive and user-friendly experience. This graphical user interface allows users to interact seamlessly with the application's features, including database queries, data visualization, and personalized recommendations.

This project highlights the integration of multiple technologies into a cohesive system, emphasizing both technical and practical aspects of database management. The use of Python bridges the backend processes with the frontend, creating a versatile tool that is both functional and interactive. Sharing this project on GitHub aims to showcase its design, implementation, and potential applications, making it a valuable reference for others exploring database systems and Python development.
